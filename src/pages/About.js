      <h3>First Day (Monday)</h3>

<p class="meeting"> We met up, and discussed on the ideas that we had, and finished on labs so that we could focus on the project. We also divided up the workload
</p>

<h3>Second Day (Tuesday)</h3>

<p class="meeting">We met for the whole day. Each one of us was working on our assigned parts. But we got a blocker cause of the API 
</p>

<h3>Third Day (Wednesday)</h3>

<p class="meeting">We worked on the User Interface(UI) while waiting for the API issue to be resolved
</p>

<h3>Fourth Day (Thursday)</h3>

<p class="meeting">We had all finished up on our UI and we were merging it to see if it will fit. We finally got an API although it was lacking on some of the requirements we were to work on.
